(defn run
  "Runs `handler` with the given `options`.

   `handler` can be a Ring handler function, a Servlet, or an
   Undertow HttpHandler. Can be called multiple times - if given the
   same options, any prior handler with those options will be replaced. Returns
   the given options with any missing defaults filled in.

   options can be a map or kwargs, with these valid keys [default]:

     * :host          The interface bind address [\"localhost\"]
     * :port          The port listening for requests [8080]
     * :path          Maps the handler to a prefix of the url path [\"/\"]
     * :virtual-host  Virtual host name[s] (a String or a List of Strings) [nil]
     * :dispatch?     Invoke handlers in worker thread pool [true]

  When `handler` is a Servlet, the following options are also supported:
  
     * :servlet-name  The servlet's registered name [the :path]
     * :filter-map    An insertion-order-preserving mapping, e.g. array-map
                      or LinkedHashMap, of names to Filter instances [nil]
  
   Note the web server only binds to the loopback interface, by
   default. To expose your handler to the network, set :host to an
   external IP address, or use \"0.0.0.0\" to bind it to all interfaces.

   The :virtual-host option enables name-based virtual hosting which,
   along with the :path option, distinguishes the handlers on a single
   server. That is, multiple handlers can run on the same `:host` and
   `:port` as long as each has a unique combination of `:virtual-host`
   and `:path`.

   Run calls may be threaded together:

   ```
     (-> (run ello)
       (assoc :path \"/owdy\")
       (->> (run owdy))
       (merge {:path \"/\" :port 8081})
       (->> (run ola)))
   ```

   The above actually creates two web server instances, one listening
   for ello and owdy requests on port 8080, and another listening
   for ola requests on 8081.

   For ring handlers, the actual writing of the response happens after
   your hander returns. If an exception occurs on the write (the most
   common case being an IOException because the client has gone away),
   the default behavior is to log the exception. If you would like to
   be able to handle that exception yourself, you can return a function
   in the ring response under :write-error-handler. This function will
   be called with the exception, the request map, and the response map
   if an exception occurs when writing the response. Note that this
   handler can't actually affect the response. If you would prefer
   a global handler, see [[immutant.web.middleware/wrap-write-error-handling]].
  
   The underlying web server for Immutant is Undertow, which supports
   more advanced options than the above. These can be configured by
   passing an `Undertow$Builder` via the :configuration option, an
   instance of which is easily constructed from a map of valid
   keywords using the [[immutant.web.undertow/options]] function. For
   convenience, all of its option keywords are valid for `run`, too:
   if present, an `Undertow$Builder` will be returned in the result.

   If your handlers are compute-bound, you may be able to gain some
   performance by setting :dispatch? to false. This causes the
   handlers to run on Undertow's I/O threads, avoiding the context
   switch of dispatching them to the worker thread pool, at the
   risk of refusing client requests under load. Note that when
   :dispatch? is false, returning a seq, File, or InputStream as a
   ring body will cause that request to be dispatched to a worker
   thread at write time to prevent blocking an I/O thread.

   Inside WildFly, the :host, :port, :configuration, and :dispatch?
   options are ignored, since all handlers are mounted as servlets
   contained within WildFly's own Undertow instance. Further, all
   invocations of `run` must be within the initialization function for
   your application, i.e. your `-main`."
